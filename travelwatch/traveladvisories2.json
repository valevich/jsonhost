Persons seeking to use the RGL must be sponsored by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on their behalf for a SafeTravel Pass. Once approved, SafeTravel Pass holders may then apply for a standard travel visa (persons holding exiting valid visas need not apply for a new visa).Persons seeking to use the RGL cannot have traveled outside either Malaysia or Brunei Darussalam during the 14 days prior to their scheduled departure for Singapore and must, at their own expense, obtain a certificate showing a negative result for COVID-19 issued no more than 72 hours prior to departure using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test performed by a laboratory accredited by the government of Brunei or Malaysian Ministry of Health. Travelers are required to produce this certificate along with their SafeTravel Pass, valid travel visa, and proof of a return ticket or other onward transportation in order to enter Singapore.Upon arrival, RGL travelers will undergo an additional PCR test at their own expense and will be transported by the host company or government agency to a non-residential accommodation where they must self-isolate while awaiting their test results. Upon confirmation of a negative test result, the host company or government agency will ensure the traveler is transported to and from their workplace for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. The host company or government agency will further ensure the traveler installs and uses the TraceTogether mobile app for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. RGL travelers are not permitted to use public transportation while in Singapore.Periodic Commuting Arrangement for Malaysian Residents From August 10, 2020, Malaysian nationals and permanent residents holding valid Singapore work passes may be eligible for a new Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) scheme allowing cross-border travel at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link.
