The host company or government agency will further ensure the traveler installs and uses the TraceTogether mobile app for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. RGL travelers are not permitted to use public transportation while in Singapore.Periodic Commuting Arrangement for Malaysian Residents From August 10, 2020, Malaysian nationals and permanent residents holding valid Singapore work passes may be eligible for a new Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) scheme allowing cross-border travel at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link.
