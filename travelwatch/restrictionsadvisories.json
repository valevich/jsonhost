Persons seeking to use the RGL must be sponsored by either a Singapore-based company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on their behalf for a SafeTravel Pass. Once approved, SafeTravel Pass holders may then apply for a standard travel visa (persons holding exiting valid visas need not apply for a new visa).Persons seeking to use the RGL cannot have traveled outside of Malaysia during the 14 days prior to their scheduled departure for Singapore and must, at their own expense, obtain a certificate showing a negative result for COVID-19 issued no more than 72 hours prior to departure using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test performed by a laboratory accredited by the Malaysian Ministry of Health. Travelers are required to produce this certificate along with their SafeTravel Pass and valid travel visa in order to enter Singapore.Upon arrival, RGL travelers will undergo an additional PCR test at their own expense and will be transported by the host company or government agency to a non-residential accommodation where they must self-isolate while awaiting their test results. Upon confirmation of a negative test result, the host company or government agency will ensure the traveler is transported to and from their workplace for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. The host company or government agency will further ensure the traveler installs and uses the TraceTogether mobile app for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. RGL travelers are not permitted to use public transportation while in Singapore.Periodic Commuting Arrangement for Malaysian Residents From August 10, 2020, Malaysian nationals and permanent residents holding valid Singapore work passes may be eligible for a new Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) scheme allowing cross-border travel at the Johor-Singapore Causeway and Malaysia-Singapore Second Link. Singapore-based employers must submit an application to use the PCA on behalf of their employees. Applications must be submitted at least 7 days prior to the employee's intended entry into Signapore and employees must be willing to remain in Singapore for at least 90 days.

Persons using the PCA, or their employers, must agree to cover all costs associated with self-isolation and testing.Fast Lane Immigration Clearance for Chinese Nationals From June 8, 2020, Chinese nationals traveling to Singapore for business purposes may qualify for special fast lane immigration clearance.

If approved, the traveler will receive an official notification letter. Persons requiring a visa may use the letter during the visa application process. Persons already holding a valid visa may use the existing visa as normal. Persons who qualify under a visa-free arrangement need not apply for a visa to use the fast lane.For at least 7 days prior to departure for Singapore, fast lane travelers must remain in one of the following provinces or municipalities in China: Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, or Zhejiang.

Failure to produce these documents may result in a denial of permission to board the aircraft.Upon arrival, fast lane travelers will undergo an additional PCR test and will be transported by the host company or government agency to a non-residential accommodation where they must self-isolate while awaiting their test results. Upon confirmation of a negative test result, the host company or government agency will ensure the traveler is transported to and from their workplace for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore.
